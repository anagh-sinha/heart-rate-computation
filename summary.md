ECG Heart Rate Analyzer - Project Summary
A clean, modular, and well-documented ECG heart rate analysis system that balances simplicity with functionality.
Key Improvements Made

1. Project Structure
Monolithic scripts and a proper Python package:
single_file_implementation: single files (robust_hrc.py, simple_clean_hrc.py)
package_implementation: modular package with clear separation of concerns

2. Code Quality

Readability: Clear variable names, comprehensive comments
Maintainability: Single responsibility functions
Testability: Tests with synthetic signal generation
Documentation: README

3. Two Methods Implemented
Autocorrelation Method

Exploits ECG periodicity
Robust to noise
Simple and elegant

Peak Detection Method

Based on Pan-Tompkins algorithm
Beat-by-beat analysis
Clinical standard approach


# How to Run
## Single file
python main.py {EDF filepath}

## Run tests
python tests/test_methods.py

# Design Philosophy
No over-engineering: Essential features only
Clear code: Self-documenting with helpful comments
Modular design: Easy to understand and extend
